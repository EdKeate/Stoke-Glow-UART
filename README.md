 # Stoke Glow UART
This PCB uses an ATMEGA328P-AU to control the headlights on a Balance board using the FLoat Package.

Features:
 - Integrated 5V 2A step-down converter.
 - Support for fusing, can be bypassed.
 - External Latching switch for button on-off support
 - 5V & Gnd Pins on JST PH pins for extra peripherals.
 - Headlight, Taillight and auxillary lighting support.
 - Small profile designed to fit inside Flowglider enclosure.

Follow [this guide](https://theboardgarage.com/articles/vesc-one-wheel-lights-arduino) from Mario Contino on how to use the headlights and wire them. The PCB has a Silkscreen layer showing how all the pins are wired, however it is still recommended to cross reference with the gerber files
